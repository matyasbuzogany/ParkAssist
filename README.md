This application was my final project during my bachelor's studies.
It was implemented using Java, Android SDK, Firebase, Google Maps API and others.

WHAT IT IS ABOUT

Cluj-Napoca used to be a mid-sized city, but a few years ago people started to realize that the quality of life there is better than in other places in the country, so they started to move to Cluj-Napoca. Numerous schools and universities have opened, and many international and local companies have opened offices. All these factors combined have put the city at the second spot on the list of cities with the highest population in Romania, second only to the capital Bucharest. The growing population of the city has caused a rather large problem: people have nowhere to park their vehicles.

Although the city has adapted to some extent by creating a good public transport system, the issue still exists to this day and it is only getting worse every year.

Cluj-Napoca has a subscription-based parking spot system for those who live in apartments throughout the city, meaning a family is entitled to a single parking spot somewhere near the building they live in, for which they pay a yearly fee.

The project is based on the possibility to share these spots with other users, helping each other out by finding temporary parking spots. For example, if somebody leaves their house every morning at 8:30 and works until 17:00, this person can let other people use his/her parking spot in the interval while at the same time he/she could use other usersâ€™ parking spots when those are available.

The application would be useful in many situations and, with the ever-growing popularity of various smart devices, it would also be convenient and easy to use for anyone.
